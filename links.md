### 1. [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
This is an excellent, free book by Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau, which covers the core concepts of operating systems in a very approachable way. It covers topics such as virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. I find this link very interesting because it breaks down complex topics into "easy pieces" that make understanding operating systems more intuitive.

### 2. [Linux Kernel Newbies](https://kernelnewbies.org/)
This site is an excellent resource for those who want to dive into Linux kernel development. It is well-suited for beginners who are just starting to understand the intricacies of the Linux kernel. It provides guides and explanations for understanding kernel patches, subsystems, and other kernel development tools. I recommend this resource for its simplicity and community-driven approach to helping new developers.

### 3. [Unix Programming Tools (UNIX History)](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/odyssey.html)
This is an article by Dennis Ritchie, co-creator of Unix, reflecting on the development of Unix. The historical insight into Unix's design makes it compelling. Understanding how early operating systems like Unix were created can give students a foundational knowledge of modern OS concepts.

### 4. [The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/design-44bsd/)
This is the official book that explains the design of the FreeBSD operating system. It covers both theoretical and practical aspects, from kernel design to system calls. I think this link is great because it delves into a popular, open-source Unix-like operating system and provides detailed explanations about its architecture.

### 5. [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)
The OSDev Wiki is a community-driven site where operating system developers collaborate and share resources. It provides tutorials on building your own operating system, including topics like bootloaders and kernel development. This link is fascinating for anyone who wants to take on the challenge of creating a custom OS from scratch.
