### 1. [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
This is an excellent, free book by Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau, which covers the core concepts of operating systems in a very approachable way. It covers topics such as virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. I find this link very interesting because it breaks down complex topics into "easy pieces" that make understanding operating systems more intuitive.

### 2. [Linux Kernel Newbies](https://kernelnewbies.org/)
This site is an excellent resource for those who want to dive into Linux kernel development. It is well-suited for beginners who are just starting to understand the intricacies of the Linux kernel. It provides guides and explanations for understanding kernel patches, subsystems, and other kernel development tools. I recommend this resource for its simplicity and community-driven approach to helping new developers.

### 3. [Free and Open Source software licenses explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMIG4KnM8xw&pp=ygUmZnJlZSBzb2Z0d2FyZSBhbmQgb3BlbiBzb3VyY2Ugc29mdHdhcmU%3D)
This is a video about an explanation about free and open souce software

### 4. [The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/design-44bsd/)
This is the official book that explains the design of the FreeBSD operating system. It covers both theoretical and practical aspects, from kernel design to system calls. I think this link is great because it delves into a popular, open-source Unix-like operating system and provides detailed explanations about its architecture.

### 5. [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)
The OSDev Wiki is a community-driven site where operating system developers collaborate and share resources. It provides tutorials on building your own operating system, including topics like bootloaders and kernel development. This link is fascinating for anyone who wants to take on the challenge of creating a custom OS from scratch.

### 6. [MIT OpenCourseWare: Operating System Engineering](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-828-operating-system-engineering-fall-2012/)
MIT's OpenCourseWare offers free courses, including their "Operating System Engineering" course. This course provides in-depth lectures, assignments, and projects focused on the principles of operating systems. It is a valuable resource for learners who want a more formal and academic approach to the subject, along with practical hands-on experience.

### 7. [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)
Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions on how to build your own custom Linux system from the ground up. This is a fantastic resource for anyone looking to get deep into Linux internals, learning how operating systems work at a fundamental level by constructing one yourself.

### 8. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)
A beginner-friendly video that covers key OS concepts like memory management and multitasking as part of the Crash Course Computer Science series.

### 9. [MIT 6.828: Operating System Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61hsJNdULdudlRL493b-XZf)
A full lecture series from MIT's Operating System Engineering course, covering advanced topics like virtual memory, processes, and concurrency.
